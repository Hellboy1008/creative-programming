        <p class="project-desc"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hellboy1008/Sudoku_Solver">Source Code (Github)</a><br><br> <b>Reason behind writing this program:</b> <br><br> I've always been a big fan of Sudoku puzzles and solving them since I was young. I used
            to buy the little booklets from the bookstores, starting from the easy level and slowly moving on to medium and expert puzzles. I learned different techniques on how to solve the puzzles from these booklets and those are the techniques I've
            been using ever since to solve any sudoku puzzles I encounter. Seeing how my techniques were pretty sufficient in solving these puzzles, I decided to write this program that would apply the same techniques as I do to solve any given sudoku
            puzzle. <br><br> <b>How this program works:</b> <br><br> These are the techniques applied to solve the puzzle: <br><br></p>
        <div class="project-body" style="display:flex;">
            <div class="project-text">
                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">1. Scanning - This is the first technique I apply before doing anything else. You go through all the digits from 1 through 9 and draw lines in the boxes that each digit cannot be placed in to help visualize where each digit could go. For
                    example, we can scan the number 1 in the sudoku on the right and find out that 1 has be in the 'X' spots since each box has to contain all the digits at least once.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">2. Pencil Marks - This is a pretty common step in solving sudoku puzzles. The process of creating pencil marks is pretty simple, you literally write all the possible values that could exist in each square for the entire puzzle. The harder
                    the puzzle is, the more tedious but also the more crucial this step becomes. For example, the puzzle on the right is filled with pencil marks.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">3. Singles - This step has to come after the pencil marks have been written into the puzzle. Only after these pencil marks is one about to see singles on the puzzle, in order words boxes in the sudoku puzzle that could only hold one possible
                    digit. For example, the puzzle of the right has a single in box I1, where this box can only hold the digit 1.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">4. Doubles - This step also has to come after the pencil marks have been written into the puzzle. This technique is a little more tricky, but basically you try and find squares in the same row, column or box that have the same pair of
                    digits that can fit in those boxes. For example, the puzzle on the right has the pair (7,8) for squares D1 and D2. This means that any other squares in the same row as D1 and D2 as well as the same box as D1 and D2 cannot hold the
                    value 7 or 8 since it has to be in either of these squares.</p>
