        <p class="project-desc"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hellboy1008/Breakout_Room_Generator">Source Code (Github)</a><br><br> <b>Reason behind writing this program:</b> <br><br> When COVID-19 suddenly plagued the world in 2020, it changed the way we interacted
            with each other in social settings. Still in college, it not only changed the format my classes were conducted but also the format of how our student organizations on campus met up. Being part of a student organization, we lost a lot of meaningful
            interactions between the members of our club due to COVID-19. We took for granted the opportunities we had in-person to linger around our meeting room, talking to new members and making new connections on the fly in a very natural setting.
            By moving to Zoom meetings online, the only form of interaction between members became breakout rooms. However, the breakout room options on Zoom are extremely simple, and you either have to manually make the rooms by assigning individual
            participants or use the random feature to randomly generate rooms. In order to maximize the number of new interactions between members of our club each week, I wrote this program to create efficient breakout rooms that maximizes the number
            of new interactions for each participant, with the goal of members meeting someone new each week.<br><br> <b>How this program works:</b> <br><br> This program takes into considerations many different factors, mostly based on how our organization
            wanted these breakout rooms to be generated: <br><br> 1. Interactions - Groups are created to maximize new interactions for each participant <br> 2. Leaders - Leaders of the group are dispersed as facilitators <br> 3. Newcomers - Newcomers
            of the group are dispersed to maximize mingling between old/new members <br> 4. Gender - Groups are created to maximize mixed gender groups<br><br> Taking these factors into consideration, the program generates groups based on a value called
            "error". Each time the breakout rooms satisfy the following conditions, the error value rises by 1: <br><br> 1. Two people in the group have already met before<br> 2. There are too many leaders in one group <br> 3. There are too many newcomers
            in one group <br>4. There is a gender imbalance within the group.<br><br> The program essentially generates thousands of random breakout rooms and computes the error value for each set of rooms based on the conditions above, and the set of
            rooms with the lowest error value (thus the most desired breakout rooms) is selected and presented to the host. The program also attempts to swap two participants from different breakout rooms to try and lower this value.<br><br> <b>Live Demo of program</b>:
