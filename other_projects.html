                <p class="project-desc">This is a creative coding project by user jayelm called neural art. This project is really awesome, it basically recreates modern photos with the art style of famous artists using their famous paintings. For example, this image on the
                    left is a recreation of Gasson Hall in Boston College with the style of Vincent Van Gogh, using his painting The Starry Night. The user utilizes neural networks and machine learning to accomplish this task. Here's my <a href="critique.html">analysis</a>                    of this awesome project.

                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">This is a creative coding project by user hamoid called text randomizer. This project is quite simple, it takes a simple text file and makes the words hard for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">Optical Character Recognition</a>.
                    Simply put, it changes the text so that it cannot be read by machines easily and can only be read by a human (though it is still hard for us too). Overall, it's a really cool project that reflects creative programming and coding something
                    that interests the author.</p>

This project is really cool, the user basically simulates a bunch of intersections and streets using the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model">Intelligent Driver Model</a>.
                    Through this simulation, the user can see how traffic lights interact with each other and possibly how they could be optimized or changed to avoid traffic jams and accidents.</a>

                <p class="project-desc project-desc-left">This is a creative coding project by user msieg called deep music visualizer. This project uses neural networks to identify the different pitches, tones, tempo, depth, etc. of a given music piece and creates a piece of art using a string
                    of images and a music piece. Here is a really <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7R-yBZ5QYc">fascinating example</a> of one of their works.</p>

                <p class="project-desc">This is a creative coding project by user s-andrews called virus outbreak simulator. It seems like this user was one step ahead of all of us and created this simulator one year before COVID to demonstrate how fast viruses can spread within
                    our bodies and attack our cells. This project is really interesting to me because it uses similar techniques to Conway's Game of Life to simulate how viruses invade our body.</p>

                    user went five steps ahead of us to write a bot that learned how to play flappy bird using machine learning. Here a
