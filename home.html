        <p class="home-header">What is creative programming?</p>
        <p class="home-desc">Creative programming is creative expression of oneself through one's coding ability. When we usually think of programming, especially in the realm of career and education, programming is thought of as a task. In programming classes and real-world
            industry, there are tasks that need to be accomplished and the programmer is expected to write code to fulfill the task as needed. Creative programming is something different. Instead of writing code to accomplish a task that has been given
            to you, you can develop new ideas and projects by yourself and be creative with what you code. These programs don't necessarily need to accomplish a specific task, but rather just a piece of code you wrote as a way to express creativity as
            well as your skills in programming.</p>

        <p class="home-header">Why is creative programming important?</p>
        <p class="home-desc" id="home_desc_2">Consider this idea: If we're just focusing on writing programs that accomplish specific tasks, what makes us different from an advanced futuristic robot that could do the same using artificial intelligence? <br><br>Creative expression in and of
            itself is a crucial part of what makes us humans. There are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.upmcmyhealthmatters.com/the-health-benefits-of-creative-expression/">numerous health benefits</a> to creative expression, such as enhancing your
            mood, reducing stress, burdens, and depression. Creative programming is also a wonderful way for a programmer to really showcase the knowledge and experience they've built up through beautiful new and innovative programs. <br><br>This site
            has examples from programs I've <a href="my_projects.html">written myself</a>, as well as creative programs written by <a href="other_projects.html">other users</a> that I was able to access through the public Github repository.</p>
