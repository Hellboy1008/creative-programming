        <p class="project-desc"><b>My thoughts on this program:</b> <br><br> I think this program is a excellent example of creative programming. To be honest, even though many programmers do explore programming and use their programming skills creatively to work on fun projects,
            it's not a field that has been studied much or explored as a whole. However, it's projects like these that really demonstrate how awesome creative programming is and how creative some users could be with the simple knowledge of a particular
            programming language they are familiar with. The user uses their knowledge of python and machine learning to combine two pictures, one from the modern world and another from a famous painting to recreate the modern image with the style of
            the famous painting. Although it does say in the description of Github that it was for a final project in a class, the project seems to be an open-ended project that lets the students decide what they want to do with their knowledge of machine
            learning. These are the kind of projects that I believe are crucial in computer science classes nowadays because it promotes application of the knowledge learned in class as well as people to be creative and free with what types of products
            they want to create. In this user's code, you can clearly see how he's extremely knowledgeable on the topic of machine learning and very comfortable with the programming language of Python.<br><br>Some possible improvements or cool features
            I can think of for this project would be to see if you could flip the process and see if you could change a famous painting and somehow "modernize" it to see how that would look like using machine learning. Also, I think it would be cool to
            have a website where users can upload photos and see the program run live and try out different pairs of photos. Overall, I think this project is a superb example of creative programming and how any programmer can use their knowledge of programming
            to create exciting projects that truly reflect their talent of creativity.</p>
